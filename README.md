I’m a cybersecurity student with a natural curiosity for how things work and a passion for tinkering. Outside of my studies, I enjoy reading, practicing sports to stay active, and diving into new subjects just for the joy of learning. I see every challenge as an opportunity to grow, both technically and personally.

Today I am in the second year of my Master's in *Cybersecurity* at the University of Pisa.  

Looking ahead, I feel grateful for the path I’ve walked so far. These experiences have taught me perseverance, curiosity, and above all the joy of learning something new every day — lessons that go far beyond textbooks.
