# :water_buffalo: Range 

I’m a cybersecurity student with a natural curiosity for how things work and a passion for tinkering. Outside of my studies, I enjoy reading, practicing sports to stay active, and diving into new subjects just for the joy of learning. I see every challenge as an opportunity to grow, both technically and personally.

## 🚀 Range's Journey

My academic path began with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science at *La Sapienza University of Rome*.  
Those years were unforgettable: long study sessions that often turned into late-night discussions with friends, professors who encouraged us to push further, and the thrill of finally solving problems that once seemed impossible. I really enjoyed programming and databases, but nothing ever sparked my curiosity as much as the **Networks course** — the moment I realized how passionate I am about the invisible threads that connect the digital world.  

Today I am in the second year of my Master's in *Cybersecurity* at the University of Pisa.  
Here I’ve found an even deeper sense of purpose: diving into cryptography, system security, and penetration testing has not only sharpened my skills but also made me more aware of how crucial this field is for our society. More importantly, I’ve met peers and mentors who share the same drive, turning challenges into shared victories and making this journey truly special.  

Looking ahead, I feel grateful for the path I’ve walked so far. These experiences have taught me perseverance, curiosity, and above all the joy of learning something new every day — lessons that go far beyond textbooks.
